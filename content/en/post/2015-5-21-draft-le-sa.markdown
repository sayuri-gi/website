Update 2015-10-12: These documents are now out of date. Please visit our [Policy and Legal Repository](/repository/) for
up-to-date documents.

Today we're publishing the first public draft of the [Let's Encrypt Subscriber Agreement](/documents/LE-SA-v1.0-June-23-2015.pdf). We've attempted to create terms that are sensible for both our organization and our subscribers, and we want to give people a chance to review them before we start issuing certificates. Please [let us know](https://groups.google.com/a/letsencrypt.org/forum/#!forum/ca-dev) if you have any questions or comments.
